# FreshBites — Food Delivery (Capstone Project)

**Theme:** Food Delivery App

**Files included:**
- `index.html` — main static HTML
- `style.css` — styles using CSS Grid & Flexbox
- `images/` — add images (food1.jpg, food2.jpg, food3.jpg, banner.jpg, chef.jpg, logo.svg)
- `README.md` — this file

**Project brief:** A responsive single-page static site representing a food delivery UI with hero banner, features, searchable menu grid, filters (visual only), contact form and footer.

**Breakpoints used:**
- Desktop: ≥1024px — 3-column menu grid
- Tablet: ~768–1024px — 2-column menu grid
- Mobile: ≤768px — single-column layout; header collapses

**How to view locally:**
1. Create a project folder and place `index.html` and `style.css` at the root.
2. Create an `images/` folder and add placeholder images named as in the file comments.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

**Accessibility notes:**
- Semantic HTML tags used (`header`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `footer`).
- All images include `alt` attributes.
- "Skip to main content" link available.
- Form labels associated with inputs.

If you'd like, I can:
- Split these into separate files and provide a zip for download.
- Add more sample cards (I can auto-generate a set of 12 cards).
- Make a GitHub-ready README and screenshots.

Tell me which of the above you want next.
